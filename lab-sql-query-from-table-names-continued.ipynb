    "- **Version 1:**  \n",
    "  This version embeds the table definitions using the standard CREATE TABLE syntax with inline sample data. A few-shot example is provided directly after the table definitions. This approach clearly informs the model about the table structures and expected sample output, resulting in accurate SQL generation.  \n",
    "- **Version 2:**  \n",
    "  This variation uses a narrative style to describe the tables and their contents. It includes a few-shot example query but relies more on plain language to describe the database schema. Although the model generally understood the requirements, this style sometimes led to less consistent adherence to SQL formatting rules compared to Version 1.  \n",
    "- **Version 3:**  \n",
    "  This version emphasizes clear instructions and formatting. The prompt instructs the model to output SQL code within a markdown code block and includes explicit formatting cues. The few-shot example is detailed, ensuring that the SQL follows a specific style. This approach yielded highly structured outputs, though in some cases the model added extra commentary that required post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations and Challenges:**  \n",
    "- **Consistency:**  \n",
    "  Version 1 provided the most consistent results regarding table structure recognition, largely because the SQL syntax was embedded directly. Version 2 sometimes resulted in slightly varied outputs because of its narrative style, while Version 3, though structured, occasionally included extra natural language commentary.\n",
    "- **Formatting:**  \n",
    "  Instructions to output SQL within markdown code blocks (Version 3) improved readability and adherence to the expected format. However, some outputs included superfluous explanations, highlighting the need for tighter prompt constraints.\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Examples:**  \n",
    "  Including few-shot examples was beneficial. The examples guided the model’s output by demonstrating the expected query structure. However, the placement and specificity of these examples were critical; too vague examples led to hallucinations or minor syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lessons Learned:**  \n",
    "1. **Prompt Specificity:**  \n",
    "   Detailed prompts with explicit SQL syntax (as in Version 1) enhance the accuracy of the generated queries.\n",
    "2. **Formatting Cues:**  \n",
    "   Clear formatting instructions, such as requiring markdown code blocks, improve the clarity of the output.\n",
    "3. **Iterative Refinement:**  \n",
    "   Iteratively testing and comparing multiple prompt styles is essential to identify the best approach for a given task. Slight variations in phrasing can significantly impact the model’s behavior.\n",
    "4. **Output Post-Processing:**  \n",
    "   Even with optimized prompts, occasional extraneous commentary may be generated. Implementing simple post-processing steps to extract the SQL code can be a practical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The experiment demonstrated that careful prompt engineering—including clear table definitions, sample rows, and few-shot examples—is crucial for generating correct SQL queries. While each variant had its strengths, Version 1 and Version 3 produced the most reliable outputs. Overall, these findings underline the importance of precise instructions and iterative refinement in achieving effective text-to-SQL generation.\n",
